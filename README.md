# 📊 Benford's Law Analysis on Spain Cities Dataset

**Team Name:** Neurominds  
**Project Type:** Mathematics + Data Analysis  
**Tools Used:** Python (Jupyter/Colab), Matplotlib, Pandas  
**Dataset:** Spain Cities Dataset

## 🧠 What is Benford’s Law?

Benford's Law predicts how often digits appear as the first digit in real-life datasets.  
According to this law, lower digits like 1 appear more often than higher digits like 9.

**Formula:**  
> P(d) = log₁₀(1 + 1/d)

## 📂 Project Summary

- Cleaned and analyzed Spain city data using Python  
- Extracted first digits from numerical values  
- Compared real distribution to Benford’s expected values  
- Visualized results using bar graphs  

---

## 📌 Key Findings

- Digit **1** had the highest frequency—just as Benford predicted  
- Moderate conformity to Benford’s Law  
- Data might need scaling for even clearer alignment
