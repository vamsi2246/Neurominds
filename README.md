## 🧠 What is Benford’s Law?

Benford's Law is a statistical principle that predicts the frequency of the first digits in many naturally occurring datasets.  
According to the law, smaller digits (especially 1) appear more often as leading digits than larger ones.

**Formula:**  
> P(d) = log₁₀(1 + 1/d)  
Where `d` is the digit from 1 to 9.

## 📂 Project Overview

We applied Benford's Law to a real-world dataset of cities in Spain, analyzing:
- The frequency of leading digits
- Comparing observed values with expected Benford distribution
- Creating visual bar plots for insight

---

## 📈 Key Observations

- Digit **1** had the highest frequency as expected  
- The dataset showed **moderate alignment** with Benford’s Law  
- Variations may occur due to limited or domain-specific data
